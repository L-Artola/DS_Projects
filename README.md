# DS_Projects

Hello, 

Welcome to my DS portfolio. All projects in this repository are side projects I have decided to make to explore interests of mine while upskilling my analytical capabilites. This portfolio is currently a work in progress and will be continously updated as I work on projects. I hope for whatever reason my Github has piqued your fancy that you will find it interesting and maybe even learn a thing or two. If you have any thoughts or comments on any of the projects you are more then welcome to contact me on Linkedin at Luke Artola.
